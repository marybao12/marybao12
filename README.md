- 👋 Hi, I’m @marybao12
- 👀 I joined github so that I can maintain my motivation on learning how to code. 
- 🌱 I’m currently just starting to learn Javascript and getting familiar with the basics. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but I will be as I get more familiar at programming. 
- 📫 How to reach me- by email: mbaoxy012@gmail.com
